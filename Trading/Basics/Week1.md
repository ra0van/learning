# What is accounting?
Formal collection, aggregation, analysis & reporting of financial and non-financial data about a company to various end users.

## Types of accounting
- Financial accounting
- Managerial accounting
- Tax accounting

### Financial Accounting
 - To provide info about the financial performance and health of the company to outsiders. This could be for valuation purposes by equity investors and investment banks for assessment of credit risk by banks and suppliers.
 - Secondary purpose of financial accounting is to monitor and evaluate the performance of managers, and to ensure that its managers use the resources responsibly.

### Managerial Accounting
- To provide information for decision making within the company.
- This info helps determine product costs, profitability and pricing, capacity planning and determining volumes. 
- Secondary purpose is for performance evaluation and cost control. Unlike financial accounting there is no fix format for managerial accounting reports and they are not audited.

### Tax Accounting
- To provide information to tax authorities


## Financial Accounting
 - A key element of financial accounting is the idea of accruals. Financial statements are based on accruals rather than on cash basis.(What does that mean? - That is transactions are recognized on financial statements when the primary economic event occurs rather than when actual cash flow occurs.)

 - This accrual based accounting allows the verification of earning and the net financial position of the company during a period. This accrual based accounting gives rise to two major financial statements namely the income statement also called a profit and loss statement and the balance sheet.

 - Accrual accounting occurs through the process of revenue recognition and matching costs to revenues. Revenue recognition means that a company can report revenue that is earned through the delivery of service or product can measure this revenue and is reasonably sure of receiving this revenue. 

 - In a nutshell, accrual accounting says that we do not have to see the cash to record a transaction.

## Balance sheet
- It captures the financial position of a company as of particular date, either the end of a quarter or end of a year.
- It consists of three parts, assets, liabilities and shareholder's equity. These parts show what the company owns, what is owes and how much shareholders have invested in the company. 
- The balance sheet has to balance out at all times.
```sh
Assets  = Liabilities + shareholders equity
```
## Assets: 
### Current Assets
* Current assets are those that are expected to be sold, converted to cash, or consumed within the next year. Everything else is non-current asset.
* Examples: Cash, cash equivalents. It includes currency, coins, checks received but not deposited, checking accounts, petty cash, savings accounts, money market accounts and short-term highly liquid investments within the majority of three months or less at the time of purchase.
* Examples : Marketable securities. This includes investments in various types of financial securities like stocks, bonds, etc. They are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents but may be converted to cash easily.
* The other two items that constitute current assets are related to the company's operations. These are inventories and accounts receivables. Inventories include all raw material that the company has bought, all working progress products as well as all finished goods.
* The last item is the accounts receivable. It includes all the money a company's client owes it. 

### Non-Current Assets
* The largest and most important contribution to non-current assets is plant property & equipment(PP&E).
* The other major part of non-current assets is intangible assets which includes nonphysical assets such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp)  & brand recognition.
* These may be worth more than the tangible assets.

---

## Liabilities
### Current Liabilities
* Obligations that are due within next one year are classified as current liabilities and everything else is called non current liabilities.
* First item under current liabilities is accounts payable. This is how much the company owes its vendors and suppliers for products and services that they have already provided or delivered. It represents how much products and services the company has purchased on credit. These are expected to be paid off by the end of the year.
* Second item under this category is accrued expenses. These are expenses that the company has incurred but has not yet received an invoice for. Examples of accrued expenses are wages, interest and utilities. The company has incurred these expenses as of the balance sheet data but it has not yet received an invoice for these expenses. Wages will fall under accrued expenses, if payroll for that period has not been processed yet.
* Third Item under this category is unearned revenue. This how much customers and clients have paid in advance for the company's products or services. This will continue to be a liability for the company until it delivers the promised products or services.
### Non-Current Liabilities
* The largest contribution is from long term debt. This includes loans and bonds which are due to be paid after one year.
## Shareholders' Equity
* Shareholders' equity also referred to as net worth. It represents the total equity interest of all the companies shareholders. It mainly includes preferred equity, common equity, treasury stock and retained earnings.
* Common equity is most important form of equity. Shareholders' having common equity have voting rights and hence, are the companies owners. They have the right to select the board of directors, which then appoints the different CXOs who in turn manage the day to day operations of the company.
* When a company sends common shares to the shareholders, the shares are usually sold at a value higher than its par value. The company receives the premium in the form of cash and hence must be recorded on the balance sheet. This is recorded as additional paid capital. It is the premium over the par value that the company receives at the time of the sale of shares to the public. 
* Treasury stock represents common stock that a company buys back from common shareholders or were authorized but was never sold to shareholders. This is recorded as cost.
* Preferred stock is another form of equity. It is the investment in the company by preferred stock holders, they have priority over common stockholders which means that company must pay them dividends before it can pay any dividends to the common stockholders. However, preferred stockholders do not have any voting rights in the company.
* The other important component of shareholder's equity on the balance sheet is retained earnings. This is an aggregate of undistributed profits across all years. The manager has discretion as to how much, if any, of the profits a company makes should be distributed to shareholders, both common and preferred as dividends. Any part of the profits that is not paid out as dividends is added to the balance sheet as a part of retained earnings.

## Income Statement
* Also known as profit and loss statement. It reports a company's operating results for the period, which largely includes its revenues and costs. The income statement is of interest to analysts, investors, and potential investors, as it tells them how profitable a company is. In a nutshell, a company's net income, which is also called profit or loss, is its revenues minus all expenses. 

### Expensing vs Capitalizing

  * Assets and expenses are two sides of the same coin. Both require the use of a companies resources. However, if the benefits of the use of this resources result in the same period as the uses itself. Then the use is categorized as an expense. The entire amount used appears on that period's income statement.
  * However, the benefits are expected to accrue in future time periods when compared to when resources are used, then the use is capitalized. This means that the entire amount used is show as an asset on the balance sheet. Examples of such capitalized expenditures are plant, property and equipment. PP& E, Purchased patents and trademarks. The capitalized expenditures are eventually charged as expenses to the income statement through two different processes. One is amortization. Two is impairment. Amortization is the process of allocating an asset's value to those future period when tis benefits are expected to be earned typically all the asset's useful life. For example, If an asset's useful life is five years then one-fifth of the asset's value will be charged as expense during each of those five years.
  * The most common example of amortization is deprecation which is terminology used for amortizing plant property & equipment.
  * In certain circumstances, market forces are nature made & destroy substantial parts of an asset's value. In such a case, we write down the value of the assets to its current fair value. That is its market value through a process of impairment. The amount of impairment is charged as an expense during the period when the value destruction occurs. Note that amortization is a periodic charge that occurs every period over the asset's life, while impairment is a one-time event.

### Revenue or Sales 
* Include only income form the companies primary lines of business or operations. It excludes income form other sources like investments.
* Revenues include only income form the companies primary lines of business or operations. It excludes income from other sources like investments.
* These will be reported later in the income statement.

## Expenses

Here, expensed refer to some of the common expenses a company incurs while generating revenues. Specifically, we will look at what cost of goods sold is, and the different types of operating expenses. Also, some of the intermediated profit measures calculated under income statement.

* COGS - Cost of goods sold. This refers to the direct costs a company incurs, in generating a warehouse full of goods or products ready to be sold. This includes raw material costs and direct labor costs that go into the production of the final product. It does not include any distribution costs or sales force costs.

The annual report notes includes the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers. And related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound costs. In summary, it includes all costs a company incurs in delivering products/services to its customers.

* The first profit measure is the gross profit. This is the difference between the company's revenues and it's COGS. It tells us how much a company makes in profits after deducting the costs, directly associated with producing and selling it's product. Or the cost directly associated with providing services. 
* Next, the income statement contains various operating expenses, which are deducted from the company's gross profits. The major component of operating expenses is selling, general and administrative expenses, referred to as SG & A. This is a non-production cost, and typically includes all selling expenses related to selling the company;s products. Like advertising expenses, rent, and salaries of the sales force. All executive salaries and costs of general support are also part of SG & A. Finally, any general operating expenses are also included in SG & A.
* Under the key component of SG & A, is depreciation and amortization expense. (Discussed as part of expensing and capitalization). Deprecation and amortization expense, occurs when the cost of acquiring an asset is  capitalized because the benefits from this asset are realized over a number of years. Rather than only in one year it was acquired.
* The number of years over which the cost of asset is spread over, is referred to as it's useful life. However, one thing to note here is that unlike other expenses on the income statement, Deprecation and amortization expense is not an amount that is paid out to someone. Hence, the deprecation and amortization expense is a on cash expense. Deprecation is the expense related to PP & E and other fixed assets. Whereas amortization is the expense related to intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, brand names, etc.
* Marketing expenses are cost incurred by the company in marketing and selling it's products and services.
* The last part of SG & A is general and administrative expenses. This includes payroll expenses, professional and litigation expenses, other corporate costs, as well as deprecation expenses. One thing to not is Amazon's income statement does not state its deprecation and amortization expense separately. It is implicitly captured under the different components of SG & A.
* Amazon's statement of cash flows, reports it's deprecation and amortization expenses to be $6.28 billion for 2015. Companies incur costs on research and development in developing new products and services. This appears as technology expenses on Amazon's income statement for 2015. 
* Under the commonly mentioned profit measure is EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortization. To get this, we will simply add deprecation and amortization expenses to EBIT. This is a relevant number, as deprecation and amortization expense is a non cash expense. Hence, this is a more relevant number in terms of profit made by the company.
* At the top of the income statement only revenues from operations are reported. But a company earns an income from investing some of their capitol in short to medium term investments that pay in interest periodically. This is recorded as interest income and is added to company's EBIT.
* Similarly, a company pays interest on moneys borrowed from various sources. This is deducted form EBIT. 
* Another expense on the income statement are those that are unusual or infrequent. Until recently they were recognized as extraordinary items on the income statement. After a recent rule change, they do not have to be recognized separately as extraordinary items, but sill have to be reported as revenue or expense as the case may be on the income statement. An example of an extraordinary event is loss of inventory because of a fire in the warehouse. This would be reported as losses due to the fire in the warehouse on the income statement. 
* The last part of income statement is corporate taxes that the company must pay. This depends on what the tax rate for the company is. The net income is also referred to as the bottom line as it is the last line in the income statement. It represents the profits, net of all expenses incurred during the year. The net income represents the total profits of the company. The income statement usually alos reports an earnings per share referred to as EPS.
* The EPS tells us how much profit the company has made for every share in the company. There are two types of EPS usually reported on an income statement, basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is based on the number of shares the company has actually sold. 
* A company makes a number of stock awards, for example a company includes employee stock options as part of its employee's compensation. These allow employees to buy the company's shares at a later date. Diluted EPS is computed as if the impact of such purchases by employees is included in the number of shares outstanding. A similar difference signifies that the dilution and ownership stake may not be very large. 
* Lastly, we look at how a company's net income is reported on the balance sheet. Common shareholders are the owners of the company, but also are the last claimants to a company;s profits. They're referred to as a residual claimants. The EPS represents what shareholders could potentially get. However, in most cases, a company will not pay its entire EPS to shareholders, as it may want to retain some of its earnings for future investments. In fact, a  number of high tech companies do not pay dividends at all as they prefer to retain profits for future investments. In case the company pays any dividends the difference between its net income and the dividends paid out to shareholders is referred to as retained earnings. This retained earnings is aggregated or accumulated on the balance sheet every year under shareholders equity.

## Statement of Cash Flows:
What is the need for statement of cash flows, the need for it and how it is different from the income statement. We will list the three main parts of the statement of cash flows. We will also discuss how to calculated cash flows from operating activities, which is the first part of the statement of cash flows. The balance sheet tracks the change in the company's cash balance from one year to the next. However, it does not tell us why the cash balance changes. 

* The income statement does not track changes to cash as everything is recorded on accrual basis. Remember accrual basis means a transaction is recorded on the income statement as soon as an economic event occurs, regardless of when the cash from this economic event is actually received or paid by the company. 
* Profits or net income cannot pay a company's bills because it does not represent cash. To that end, the income statement is not very helpful in tracking why cash and which changes in cash during the year may be attributed to. This helps in determining the ability of a company to pay it's suppliers, pay it's employees, make interest and dividend payments, repay loans, buy PP &E needed for expansion etc.
* The statement of cash flow separates the charge in cash and cash equivalents from the beginning to the end of the year into three categories, namely cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. 
* Cash flows from operating activities are those related to the company's operations-related current-assets and current liabilities. 
* Cash flows from investing activities are those related to company's non-current assets.
* Cash flows from financing activities are those related to the company's non-current liabilities and shareholder's equity. 
* To determine cash flows from operating activities, there are two ways. One is through direct method and the other is through indirect method. Under direct method of calculating cash flows form operations, cash inflows and outflows are directly reported. This method is simple and easy to understand. However it is costly for companies to maintain this method as they have to maintain very detailed cash records. Under the indirect method of calculating cash flows from operating activities, adjustments to net income are made to reflect only cash receipts and disbursements. This is because net income is calculated following accrual principles and not on cash basis. This adjustments to net income typically fall into two categories. one is adjusting for items that affect net income, but not cash. 
* These are recognized on the income statement, though no cash has been paid or received for these. The second adjustment is for items that affect cash, but not net income. An example of this is raw materials and supplies that a company has purchased with cash. This is not reflected on the income statement until the inventory is sold, but the cash paid to buy is not recognized on the income statement.

## Cash flows from Operations:

* e will look at all the adjustments that need to be made to compute a company's cash flows from operating activities. These include adjusting for non-cash expenses, expenses related to investing and financing activities, as well as cash flows related to current assets and current liabilities. 
* Let's start looking at cash flow from operating activities. While there are a number of items on its statement of cash flows, we will only discuss the most common and important of these adjustments. The first item is net income. To this we make adjustments for various items. The first set of adjustments are for non-cash expenditures, as well as expenditures related to investing and financing activities. These adjustments eliminate the impact of these items on the company's cash balance.
  Cash-based investing and financing expenses will be adjusted for later in the cash flow from investing and financing activity sections respectively off the statement of cash flows.
* The first major adjustment is for depreciation and amortization expenses which are non-cash expenses. This means that while they are deducted from revenues when calculating profits, this expense is not paid or owed to anyone. To this extent, the net income understates the amount of cash a company has. So the depreciation and amortization expense will have to be added back in full to the net income while making adjustments.  The next adjustment is for non-cash base salaries. All executive and employee salaries are recorded under SG and E and deducted from revenues. However, not all salaries will be paid in cash.
* Part of it may include stock-based compensation. While this compensation is recognized as an expense on the income statement, this, again, is cash not paid to employees. The net income again understates the cash on hand. Some of a company's operating expenses may not have been in cash and so, again, the net income understates how much cash a company has. This amount must also be added back in full to the net income. 
*  company may earn income from interest and other sources, and may also incur other types of costs, none of which are related to its operations. The impact of these non-cash items must be removed from the net income. Had any non-operating income been greater than any non-operating expenses, the number would have to be subtracted from net income as the income net of expenses are not related to operations.
* The other major adjustment to net income for non-cash expenses is any deferred income taxes. The income statement reports how much tax a company should pay. However, at times, depending on tax laws, not all taxes may be paid off. Some of it may be deferred to the future. So deducting the entire tax due from revenues underreports how much cash a company has. Any deferred taxes will have to be added to net income.
  This figure should be added back to net income as they are not related to operations. Had any non-operating income been greater than any non-operating expenses, the number would have to be subtracted from net income as the income net of expenses are not related to operations.
* The other major adjustment to net income for non-cash expenses is any deferred income taxes. The income statement reports how much tax a company should pay. However, at times, depending on tax laws, not all taxes may be paid off. Some of it may be deferred to the future. So deducting the entire tax due from revenues underreports how much cash a company has. Any deferred taxes will have to be added to net income.
* The next set of adjustments is operations related. These largely include adjustments due to changes to the firm's operations related current assets and current liabilities. This tells us how much the company has spent on purchasing raw materials and supplies but this is not recorded on the income statement until the inventory is sold. In other words it tells us how much cash the company has tied up in inventory. Consequently the net income overstates how much cash a company has at the end of the year and any increase must be deducted from net income. If inventory had not changed between the consecutive years then no inventory related adjustment is necessary because the company has not invested more cash in inventory. On the other hand, if inventory had decreased, the company would have converted inventory to cash and the cash on hand would have increased by the amount of inventory sold.
* Decreases in inventory must be added to the net income. The same argument holds for all other types of operations related current assets. For example if accounts receivable increases, it denotes that company has not received cash for at least some of its sales. So the revenue and the net income overstate how much cash the company has.
  This increase is subtracted from net income on the statement of cash flows. The reverse is true for changes to operations related current liabilities. That is increases in current liabilities must be added to net income and decreases must be subtracted from net income. For example, an increase in accounts payable tells us that the company still has not paid some of its suppliers for products and services that the suppliers have already provided. However, the cost of these products and services are subtracted from revenues while calculating net income. So the net income understates how much cash a company has when accounts payable increases.

## Cash Flow from Investing and Financing:

* The next part of the statement of cash flows is the cash flows from investing activities. This part includes all ways in which a company invests its cash in assets, both current as well as non-current. These investments are not reported on the income statement, but represent actual cash paid or received. Like we saw for operations related current assets any increase in investment assets will mean that the company has spent cash to buy these assets and will result in a reduction in cash.

* The main item here is the purchase, maturity, and sale of any marketable securities. Any net purchases would mean cash was spent and would be deducted. Any net sales would mean cash was received and would be added. 

* The next part of the statement of cash flows is the cash flows from financing activities. These relate to the increase and decrease in non-current liabilities as well as financing-related current liabilities. Similar to what we saw for adjustments for change and current liabilities, any increase in financing activities would result in an increase in cash, and any decrease in financing activities would result in a decrease in cash. An increase in financing activities means that the company has raised additional capital from various sources, and so it has more cash on hand. Conversely, a decrease would mean that the company has paid back some of its investors which means that the amount of cash on hand decreases. Since these are cash outflows, they are deducted. None of these changes are reported on the income statement, which is why we are making these adjustments to cash on the statement of cash flows.
