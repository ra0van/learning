## Financial Accounting
 - A key element of financial accounting is the idea of accurals. Financial statements are based on accruals rather than on cash basis.(What does that mean? - That is transactions are recognized on financial statements when the primary economic event occurs rather than when acutal cash flow occurs.)
 - This accrual based accounting allows the verification of earning and the net financial position of the comapny during a period. This accrual based accounting gives rise to two major financial staements namely the income statement also called a profit and loss statement and the balance sheet.
 - 
 - Accrual accounting occurs through the process of revenue recognition and matching costs to revenues. Revenue recogniotion means that a company can report revenue that is earned through the delivery of service or product can measure this revenue and is reasonably sure of receiving this revenue. 
 - In a nutshell, accrual accounting says that we do not have to see the cash to record a transaction. 
 

## Balance sheet
- It captures the financial position of a company as of particular date, either the end of a quarter or end of a year.
- It consists of three parts, assets, liabilities and shareholder's equity. These parts show what the company owns, what is owes and how much shareholders have invested in the company. 
- The balance sheet has to balance out at all times.

Assets  = Liabilities + shareholders equity
