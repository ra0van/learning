# What is accounting?
Formal collection, aggregation, analysis & reporting of financial and non-financial data about a company to various end users.

## Types of accounting
- Financial accounting
- Managerial accounting
- Tax accounting

### Financial Accounting
 - To provide info about the financial performance and health of the company to outsiders. This could be for valuation purposes by equity investors and investment banks for assessment of credit risk by banks and suppliers.
 - Secondary purpose of financial accounting is to monitor and evaluate the performance of managers, and to ensure that its managers use the resources responsibly.

### Managerial Accounting
- To provide information for decision making within the company.
- This info helps determine product costs, profitability and pricing, capacity planning and determining volumes. 
- Secondary purpose is for performance evaluation and cost control. Unlike financial accounting there is no fix format for managerial accounting reports and they are not audited.

### Tax Accounting
- To provide information to tax authorities


## Financial Accounting
 - A key element of financial accounting is the idea of accruals. Financial statements are based on accruals rather than on cash basis.(What does that mean? - That is transactions are recognized on financial statements when the primary economic event occurs rather than when actual cash flow occurs.)

 - This accrual based accounting allows the verification of earning and the net financial position of the company during a period. This accrual based accounting gives rise to two major financial statements namely the income statement also called a profit and loss statement and the balance sheet.

 - Accrual accounting occurs through the process of revenue recognition and matching costs to revenues. Revenue recognition means that a company can report revenue that is earned through the delivery of service or product can measure this revenue and is reasonably sure of receiving this revenue. 

 - In a nutshell, accrual accounting says that we do not have to see the cash to record a transaction.

## Balance sheet
- It captures the financial position of a company as of particular date, either the end of a quarter or end of a year.
- It consists of three parts, assets, liabilities and shareholder's equity. These parts show what the company owns, what is owes and how much shareholders have invested in the company. 
- The balance sheet has to balance out at all times.
```sh
Assets  = Liabilities + shareholders equity
```
## Assets: 
### Current Assets
* Current assets are those that are expected to be sold, converted to cash, or consumed within the next year. Everything else is non-current asset.
* Examples: Cash, cash equivalents. It includes currency, coins, checks received but not deposited, checking accounts, petty cash, savings accounts, money market accounts and short-term highly liquid investments within the majority of three months or less at the time of purchase.
* Examples : Marketable securities. This includes investments in various types of financial securities like stocks, bonds, etc. They are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents but may be converted to cash easily.
* The other two items that constitute current assets are related to the company's operations. These are inventories and accounts receivables. Inventories include all raw material that the company has bought, all working progress products as well as all finished goods.
* The last item is the accounts receivable. It includes all the money a company's client owes it. 

### Non-Current Assets
* The largest and most important contribution to non-current assets is plant property & equipment(PP&E).
* The other major part of non-current assets is intangible assets which includes nonphysical assets such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, goodwill (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp)  & brand recognition.
* These may be worth more than the tangible assets.

## Liabilities
### Current Liabilities
* Obligations that are due within next one year are classified as current liabilities and everything else is called non current liabilities.
* First item under current liabilities is accounts payable. This is how much the company owes its vendors and suppliers for products and services that they have already provided or delivered. It represents how much products and services the company has purchased on credit. These are expected to be paid off by the end of the year.
* Second item under this category is accrued expenses. These are expenses that the company has incurred but has not yet received an invoice for. Examples of accrued expenses are wages, interest and utilities. The company has incurred these expenses as of the balance sheet data but it has not yet received an invoice for these expenses. Wages will fall under accrued expenses, if payroll for that period has not been processed yet.
* Third Item under this category is unearned revenue. This how much customers and clients have paid in advance for the company's products or services. This will continue to be a liability for the company until it delivers the promised products or services.
### Non-Current Liabilities
* The largest contribution is from long term debt. This includes loans and bonds which are due to be paid after one year.
## Shareholders' Equity
* Shareholders' equity also referred to as net worth. It represents the total equity interest of all the companies shareholders. It mainly includes preferred equity, common equity, treasury stock and retained earnings.
* Common equity is most important form of equity. Shareholders' having common equity have voting rights and hence, are the companies owners. They have the right to select the board of directors, which then appoints the different CXOs who in turn manage the day to day operations of the company.
* When a company sends common shares to the shareholders, the shares are usually sold at a value higher than its par value. The company receives the premium in the form of cash and hence must be recorded on the balance sheet. This is recorded as additional paid capital. It is the premium over the par value that the company receives at the time of the sale of shares to the public. 
* Treasury stock represents common stock that a company buys back from common shareholders or were authorized but was never sold to shareholders. This is recorded as cost.
* Preferred stock is another form of equity. It is the investment in the company by preferred stock holders, they have priority over common stockholders which means that company must pay them dividends before it can pay any dividends to the common stockholders. However, preferred stockholders do not have any voting rights in the company.
* The other important component of shareholder's equity on the balance sheet is retained earnings. This is an aggregate of undistributed profits across all years. The manager has discretion as to how much, if any, of the profits a company makes should be distributed to shareholders, both common and preferred as dividends. Any part of the profits that is not paid out as dividends is added to the balance sheet as a part of retained earnings.

## Income Statement
* Also known as profit and loss statement. It reports a company's operating results for the period, which largely includes its revenues and costs. The income statement is of interest to analysts, investors, and potential investors, as it tells them how profitable a company is. In a nutshell, a company's net income, which is also called profit or loss, is its revenues minus all expenses. 

### Expensing vs Capitalizing

  * Assets and expenses are two sides of the same coin. Both require the use of a companies resources. However, if the benefits of the use of this resources result in the same period as the uses itself. Then the use is categorized as an expense. The entire amount used appears on that period's income statement.
  * However, the benefits are expected to accrue in future time periods when compared to when resources are used, then the use is capitalized. This means that the entire amount used is show as an asset on the balance sheet. Examples of such capitalized expenditures are plant, property and equipment. PP& E, Purchased patents and trademarks. The capitalized expenditures are eventually charged as expenses to the income statement through two different processes. One is amortization. Two is impairment. Amortization is the process of allocating an asset's value to those future period when tis benefits are expected to be earned typically all the asset's useful life. For example, If an asset's useful life is five years then one-fifth of the asset's value will be charged as expense during each of those five years.
  * The most common example of amortization is deprecation which is terminology used for amortizing plant property & equipment.
  * In certain circumstances, market forces are nature made & destroy substantial parts of an asset's value. In such a case, we write down the value of the assets to its current fair value. That is its market value through a process of impairment. The amount of impairment is charged as an expense during the period when the value destruction occurs. Note that amortization is a periodic charge that occurs every period over the asset's life, while impairment is a one-time event.

### Revenue or Sales 
* Include only income form the companies primary lines of business or operations. It excludes income form other sources like investments.
* Revenues include only income form the companies primary lines of business or operations. It excludes income from other sources like investments.
* These will be reported later in the income statement.

## Expenses

Here, expensed refer to some of the common expenses a company incurs while generating revenues. Specifically, we will look at what cost of goods sold is, and the different types of operating expenses. Also, some of the intermediated profit measures calculated under income statement.

* COGS - Cost of goods sold. This refers to the direct costs a company incurs, in generating a warehouse full of goods or products ready to be sold. This includes raw material costs and direct labor costs that go into the production of the final product. It does not include any distribution costs or sales force costs.

The annual report notes includes the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers. And related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound costs. In summary, it includes all costs a company incurs in delivering products/services to its customers.

* The first profit measure is the gross profit. This is the difference between the company's revenues and it's COGS. It tells us how much a company makes in profits after deducting the costs, directly associated with producing and selling it's product. Or the cost directly associated with providing services. 
* Next, the income statement contains various operating expenses, which are deducted from the company's gross profits. The major component of operating expenses is selling, general and administrative expenses, referred to as SG & A. This is a non-production cost, and typically includes all selling expenses related to selling the company;s products. Like advertising expenses, rent, and salaries of the sales force. All executive salaries and costs of general support are also part of SG & A. Finally, any general operating expenses are also included in SG & A.
* Under the key component of SG & A, is depreciation and amortization expense. (Discussed as part of expensing and capitalization). Deprecation and amortization expense, occurs when the cost of acquiring an asset is  capitalized because the benefits from this asset are realized over a number of years. Rather than only in one year it was acquired.
* The number of years over which the cost of asset is spread over, is referred to as it's useful life. However, one thing to note here is that unlike other expenses on the income statement, Deprecation and amortization expense is not an amount that is paid out to someone. Hence, the deprecation and amortization expense is a on cash expense. Deprecation is the expense related to PP & E and other fixed assets. Whereas amortization is the expense related to intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, brand names, etc.
* Marketing expenses are cost incurred by the company in marketing and selling it's products and services.
* The last part of SG & A is general and administrative expenses. This includes payroll expenses, professional and litigation expenses, other corporate costs, as well as deprecation expenses. One thing to not is Amazon's income statement does not state its deprecation and amortization expense separately. It is implicitly captured under the different components of SG & A.
* Amazon's statement of cash flows, reports it's deprecation and amortization expenses to be $6.28 billion for 2015. Companies incur costs on research and development in developing new products and services. This appears as technology expenses on Amazon's income statement for 2015. 
* Under the commonly mentioned profit measure is EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortization. To get this, we will simply add deprecation and amortization expenses to EBIT. This is a relevant number, as deprecation and amortization expense is a non cash expense. Hence, this is a more relevant number in terms of profit made by the company.
